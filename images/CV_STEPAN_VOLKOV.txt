About:
Hi, I’m Stefan. I’m currently exploring my path, drawn to creative fields like design and game development. I’m open to all kinds of projects, collaborations, and opportunities — feel free to look around and reach out!

Experience:
Graphic Designer - NDA
2023 - 2025
As the lead graphic designer, I was responsible for branding, UI/UX design, and photo editing, working closely with the development team and clients. I led the visual direction of projects, creating logos, website interfaces, and seasonal graphics, with most design decisions falling under my control. Using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, I delivered work that received positive feedback, especially for logo designs. I also created simple GIFs and kept design assets well-organized to support team efficiency.

Frelance - Multiple small projets
2021 - 2023
As a Game Designer, I contributed to multiple small-scale projects, focusing on crafting engaging gameplay experiences and exploring interactive storytelling. Working independently and collaboratively, I took on a variety of design tasks—from conceptualizing game mechanics to refining player experience. These projects were part of an ongoing creative journey, allowing me to continuously experiment, grow, and define my own approach to game design as both a profession and a way of life.
